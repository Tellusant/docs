# Tellusant Publications
This repository contains various published materials by Tellusant team members.  

It uses markdown language. This is to make the posts 1) have longevity beyond what social media offer; and 2) allow for fast search engine and AI crawling and indexing.  

It will include Tellusant Quick Reads, reports, white papers, and press releases; Figshare intellectual contributions such as doctoral dissertation, journal articles, and papers, our LinkedIn posts, articles, and newsletters; and more.  

The work to build the repository started started in September 2025.
