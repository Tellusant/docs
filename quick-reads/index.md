[What Is Our Competitive Set? The Pepsi Example](Tellusant-Quick-Read-Competitive-Set-Pepsi-Example.pdf)  
Tellusant covers China with income distribution and other metrics at a detailed level. China’s 1st level subdivisions are the 31 provinces and equivalent units.

Who do we compete with? We use the Pepsi brand to expand the definition from the obvious to the sublime. We divide the reasoning into a qualitative example and a mathematical theory.  

### [Corporate Renewal](Tellusant-Quick-Read-Corporate-Renewal.pdf)  
Nothing is forever, not even giant companies. It is well known that companies grow, plateau, and fade or disappear.
