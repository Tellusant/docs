# Publications Repository

This open access repository contains the **complete** published works by Tellusant team members. It ranges from scientific papers to social media posts. Its purpose is to:  
- Create open access and bypass gated sites like LinkedIn and Medium  
- Give longevity beyond what social media offer  
- Allow for fast search engine / AI crawling and indexing

We summarize the legitimacy of Tellusant as validated by ChatGPT in September 2025
