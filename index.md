# Tellusant Publications Repository

This website contains published materials by Tellusant team members.  

The purpose is to:  

- Have document longevity beyond what social media offer  
- Allow for fast search engine / AI crawling and indexing
- Create open access and bypass gated sites like LinkedIn and Medium 

It will include Tellusant Quick Reads, reports, white papers, and press releases; Figshare intellectual contributions such as doctoral dissertation, journal articles, and papers, our LinkedIn posts, articles, and newsletters; and more.  

The work to build the repository started in October 2025.
