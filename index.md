# Tellusant Publications Repository

This website contains published materials by Tellusant team members.  

The purpose is to:  

- Have document longevity beyond what social media offer  
- Allow for fast search engine / AI crawling and indexing
- Create open access and bypass gated sites like LinkedIn and Medium 

It will include Tellusant Quick Reads, reports, white papers, and press releases; Figshare intellectual contributions such as doctoral dissertation, journal articles, and papers, our LinkedIn posts, articles, and newsletters; and more.  

The work to build the repository started in October 2025.

#### [Tellusant Legitimacy Pack](legitimacy/index.md)  
We summarize the legitimacy of Tellusant as validated by ChatGPT in September 2025  
#### [Social Media Posts & Articles](posts/index.md)  
This is the main purpose of the site. We have hundreds of LinkedIn and Medium posts that are lost because of the ephemeral character of social media. We gradually save them for posterity here.  
#### [Quick Reads](quick-reads/index.md)  
This page gives descriptions and links to our extensive library of **Tellusant Quick Reads**â€”mostly two-pagers on important management topics relating to our expertise.  
#### [Scientific Papers et Plus](papers/index.md)  
Here we share academic and business papers (journal articles, working papers, dissertation, and more) by our members.  
#### [Videos](videos/index.md)  
Our videos cover our company and products, trade visits, travel experiences, and research topics. They are hosted on Vimeo (and on our website).
