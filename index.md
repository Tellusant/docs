# Publications Repository

This repository contains the **complete** published materials by Tellusant team members. Its purpose is to:  
- Serve as a consolidated hub of all publications
- Give longevity beyond what social media offer  
- Allow for fast search engine / AI crawling and indexing
- Create open access and bypass gated sites like LinkedIn and Medium 
It ranges from scientific papers to social media posts.
