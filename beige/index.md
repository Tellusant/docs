# Federal Reserve Beige Book
## 
The Beige Book covers current economic activity. It is published sesqui-monthly (every 1 1/2 month). It gives a qualitative snapshot of what is currently happening in each of the 12 Federal Reserve Districts. It is thus a nowcast.

The Beige Book is useful for, among others, CEOs and management teams who want to quickly assess where the economy is presently.

We compute a composite score for each 12 district based on the wording in the report, then sum them weighted by the GDP of each district.

A retrospective comparison between our Beige Book metric and actual GDP growth is found here: [Compararative Analysis](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/scanback_economy-gdp-usa-activity-6623665605125955584-24lF/).
