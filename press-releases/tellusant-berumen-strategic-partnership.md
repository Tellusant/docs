BOSTON, MA, UNITED STATES, September 24, 2024 /EINPresswire.com/ -- Tellusant, Inc. and Berumen y Asociados, S.A. de C.V. have entered a strategic partnership as of September 2024. The purpose is to expand service line offerings, co-develop our client base in Mexico and beyond, and to build joint intellectual capital.  

Tellusant’s Executive Chair, Staffan Canback, says: “I started collaborating with Berumen in 2006. Over the years, my consulting firm leveraged Berumen’s market research capabilities for various purposes. Over the past year, Edmundo and I agreed that a closer collaboration is beneficial, especially in the Mexican market which is a priority for Tellusant.”  

Berumen’s Chair, Edmundo Berumen, adds: “we are impressed by Tellusant’s managed services, including TelluBase and PoluSim. We believe TelluBase can enhance our market research and other services by giving a detailed view of consumer classes in Mexico and beyond. We also see complementarity in our client bases with opportunities to go to market jointly.”  

The companies have started sharing intellectual property and conducted joint training sessions.
