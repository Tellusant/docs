# Subnational ICT Opportunities in South Africa
## Case Example for How to Use TelluBase Income Distribution Data  

There is a strong trend among global companies toward understanding markets at subnational levels. They always face local players who have a keen sense for subnational opportunities.  

**TelluBase** is immensely useful for understanding subnational markets. It contains macro and consumer data for 218 countries, 2600 cities, and 2500 subdivisions (states, provinces, regions, etc.)  

The power of TelluBase is when its statistically data are combined with industry and category. The data on their own can be illuminating ("the middle class and above in Lima is growing at 8% per year"), but the combination with other data is what leads to true insights and action ("we see an untapped market opportunity for our toothpaste at a mainstream price point of 200 million people in 2035, up from 80 million today").
