#### [Staffan Canback: The World Is My Oyster: Personal Reflections from a Career in Global Business](S.Canback-Harvard-Club-Boston-Speech.pdf)  
This is my inaugural speech for the Harvard Club of Boston's new business interest group: “The World Is My Oyster: Personal Reflections from a Career in Global Business.” It starts with a few slides on tariffs and recessions, then segues to the real topic: why, where, and what in global business.

#### [Staffan Canbäck: Where in the World Is the Market? Real World Meets Math — and Math Wins](S.Canback-Harvard-Club-Boston-Speech.pdf)  
This educational deck contains an overview of Tellusant's methods interlaced with travel stories, and a breakout session for the students in three groups. The materials were used at a lecture at Lund University for masters students in May 2024.
