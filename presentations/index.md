#### [Staffan Canback: The World Is My Oyster: Personal Reflections from a Career in Global Business](S.Canback-Harvard-Club-Boston-Speech.pdf)  
This is my inaugural speech for the Harvard Club of Boston's new business interest group: “The World Is My Oyster: Personal Reflections from a Career in Global Business.” It starts with a few slides on tariffs and recessions, then segues to the real topic: why, where, and what in global business.

#### [Staffan Canbäck: Where in the World Is the Market? Real World Meets Math — and Math Wins](S.Canback-Harvard-Club-Boston-Speech.pdf)  
This educational deck contains an overview of Tellusant's methods interlaced with travel stories, and a breakout session for the students. The materials were used at a lecture at Lund University for master's students in May 2024.

#### [Staffan Canbäck: From Greenlands to Tellusant: Academic Research Meets Real-World Management Problems](S.Canback-Greenlands-Tellusant.pdf)  
The presentation describes my journey from Henley doctoral research to founding two global companies: Canback Consulting and Tellusant. It shows how the general learnings from the doctorate can be applied to address important business issues.  

#### [Staffan Canbäck: 18 Rays of Project Management](S.Canback-18-Rays-of-Project-Management.pdf)  
A while back I created this training material for project managers in **strategy consulting**. I am now sharing it widely since it is useful to a broader audience. 

A central theme is that project management is much more than putting together presentations. It covers all kinds of high-level cognitive efforts.
