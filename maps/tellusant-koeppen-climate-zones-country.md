# The World by Köppen Climate Zones
## *Uses of TelluBase* Series

The map shows the population-weighted climate zones by country. That is, the climate where people live, rather than geographic area climate (e.g., Algeria has Mediterranean, not desert climate).  

Note: Only a handful of countries have diffuse climate zones (notably U.S., China) where there is no truly dominant climate.
