# China – Cities and Secondary Subdivisions Covered in TelluBase
## *Uses of TelluBase* Series

The map shows how TelluBase covers 425 cities and 342 secondary subdivisions in China.  

Note that what many think are cities, the so-called prefecture-level cities (PLC), are not cities at all. They are secondary subdivisions and may contain many cities (at least one; up to eight) and always have rural areas.
