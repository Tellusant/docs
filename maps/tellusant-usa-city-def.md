# United States – Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSA) Covered in TelluBase
## *Uses of TelluBase* Series

States are often too high level for insights in the U.S. Counties are too detailed. The U.S. government therefore developed Metropolitan Statistcial Areas to allow for better policy making. Instead of subdividing the entire country, the MSAs focus on cities.

Our **TelluBase** database uses MSAs to define cities down to 100,000 inhabitants.
