# Tellusant Legitimacy Evidence Pack

#### [Return to home](../index.md)  

---
This page summarizes the legitimacy of Tellusant as validated by ChatGPT.  

It is the result of a multi-step process where ChatGPT was asked to review various URLs related to Tellusant. From this, it created a **Legitimacy Evidence Pack** in a PDF. The content is shown here.  

The main point is that we received an excellent score because of external validation (outside-in). What we publish ourselves, while good, does not add to Tellusant’s legitimacy since it represents our own claims and is not verified.

## 2. Independent Corporate Validation
- **Constellation Brands** (2025) — 8-K in SEC filing Exhibit 99.2 cites Tellusant analyses.  
*The fact that “Constellation Brands and Tellusant analyses” appears in Exhibit 99.2 means Tellusant’s work was considered reliable enough to be cited in a regulated disclosure. That’s not something an unserious entity could pull off.*  
[Constellation Brands – FY25 Financial Results & FY26 to FY28 Outlook](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/16918/000001691825000017/stzex99-2_022825.pdf)  
- **Ambev** (2022) — Investor Day deck cites “Tellusant and IWSR data.”  
*Ambev is one of the largest brewers in the world (part of AB InBev) with a market cap in the tens of billions. For them to cite Tellusant in a high-profile Investor Day presentation means Tellusant’s analytics were not just used internally but trusted enough to present to investors, analysts, and the market.*  
[Ambev Investor Day 2022](https://api.mziq.com/mzfilemanager/v2/d/c8182463-4b7e-408c-9d0f-42797662435e/f31c176e-633d-99fb-caae-c934ad029319?origin=1)

*Taken together, these references show Tellusant is not a shell or purely self-promotional firm. It is a credible analytics partner that has been vetted and publicly cited by leading multinationals.*

- **Legitimacy**: Supported by corporate references (Constellation Brands, Ambev), academic repositories (Figshare, SSRN), widespread citations (Wikipedia), formal partnerships (Berumen, Bernstein), confirmed public/media appearances (DI, Harvard Club of Boston), and operational product sites plus media channels (TelluBase, TelluPlan, PoluSim, Vimeo).  
- **Scale**: A multi-office firm with U.S. and Latin American presence, recognized across corporate, academic, public, partnership, and media domains.

*Tellusant’s legitimacy is reinforced by corporate usage, academic presence, widespread citations, formal partnerships, media recognition, and multi-channel product platforms.*

We reversed the process by asking ChatGPT whether this page reflects ChatGPT's verification.  
*The core substance aligns very well, with a few minor differences in wording, order, and emphasis compared to what I’ve drafted in the pack.*  

---

Finally, what does **CoPilot** say? *You asked about Tellusant Inc.'s legitimacy as seen by outsiders, and I’ve reviewed 2,025 internal files, several emails, 8 meetings, and multiple public sources. The evidence overwhelmingly supports Tellusant’s credibility and recognition across corporate, academic, and public domains.*
