#### [Staffan Canback & Frank D'Agnese: Where in the World Is the Market?](Canback-D'Agnese-Where-in-the-World-Is-the-Market.pdf)
Finding, measuring and capturing market opportunities in emerging countries are critical tasks for multinational consumer goods companies. Central to these tasks is the need to collect and analyze income distribution data within a globally coherent framework and to move beyond income metrics based on national averages.  

#### [Burginyoung et al.: The Consumer Impact of Pricing Actions](Burginyoung-et-al-Consumer-Impact-of-Pricing-Actions.pdf)
Consumer goods companies have increasingly been in the news for raising prices in today’s high global inflationary environment. With uncertainty about the true size and effect of these price increases, we examine how pricing is impacting both company volumes and consumer ability to pay on a global scale.  

#### [Canback: Bureaucratic Limits of Firm Size - Empirical Analysis Using Transaction Cost Economics](Canback-Bureaucratic-Limits-of-Firm-Size-Doctoral-Dissertation.pdf)  
Dr. Canback's seminal dissertation outlines a theory of scale diseconomies in large firms and quantifies the drivers of those disceconomies and mitigating factors. It won first prize in EDAMBA's competition for best dissertation in management science in 2002.  

In addition to the subject matter, the dissertation deploys **sophisticated statistical analysis methods later used within Tellusant**. In particular, structural equation modeling.

#### [Canback: Bureaucratic Limits of Firm Size - Practitioner Summary](Canback-Bureaucratic-Limits-of-Firm-Size-Practitioner-Summary.pdf)  
This is an easy to digest summary of the dissertation void of any quantitative analysis.

#### [Canback: The Growth Tesseract: A Scientific View of Firms’ Growth Opportunities ](Canback-Growth-Tesseract.pdf)
Growth is an important topic for most firms. Yet they often lack a framework for organizing their thoughts on growth. This may lead
to an inability to identify, quantify, and capture growth opportunities. This paper, based on parts of Dr. Canback's doctoral research, sheds light on the issue.  

#### [Canback & Burginyoung: Strategic Planning - The Tellusant Synthesis](Canback-Burginyoung-Strategic-Planning-Tellusant-Synthesis.pdf)
Strategic planning often suffers from inconsistencies by cycle and business unit, a slow process, and a lack of faith in results. Companies need to find solutions to improve this critical aspect of their business.

The starting place for any improvement in planning is to have a strong underlying strategy framework that anchors a company on its goals. This guide describes a structured approach to ensuring a better strategic planning process and how it links back to strategic thinking authorities.
