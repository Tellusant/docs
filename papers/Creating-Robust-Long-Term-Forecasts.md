# Creating Robust Long-Term Forecasts: The Tellusant 7-Step Method

***Staffan Canback***  

This short document describes how sophisticated and careful our long-term predictive models are and allows readers to glean under the hood.  

Each step may look easy, but in combination we are unique in the world to make long-term models like these. How we do it in practice is proprietary to us. What you see here are some of the building blocks, at a high level. 

We do not build models for customers, per se. We use them to support our strategic planning products into which we integrate predictive models. Our focus is on helping improve decision making, not delivering models.  

Having said this, our predictive models are as good or better than anything else in the world. The latest example is PACE (Pricing Aligned with Consumer Economics), which builds on what we describe here, and more.
